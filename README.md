# Oscars_Storytelling
##  Great stories and great visual effects

1. Set up a data science project structure in a new git repository in your GitHub account
2. Download any of the data sets from previous projects
3. Load the data set into panda data frames
4. Formulate one/two ideas on how storytelling and visualization would help describe data set and establish additional value
5. Build three or more compelling visualizations
6. Document your process and results
7. Commit your notebook, source code, visualizations and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub

###### Problem:

###### Data Set Analysis

  5. Proportion of match outcomes
  6. Goals scored in each league

###### - Relevant Notebook: **Match_Analysis.ipynb** under **_/notebook_**
          All the visualizations and code could be found here consolidated and documented.
